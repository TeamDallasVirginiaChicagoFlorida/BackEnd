Establishing Norms

Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions
What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
-If 2 or more people disagree then we will come together as a whole group and vote

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
-Let the individual take a 5-10 minute break

What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.
-Person A: What can I do to help you understand?

-Person B: (Answer will vary)

-Person C: Let's all work together to figure this out

What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
-commit often and regularly 
-communicate with other teammates about pull and commit requests
-make time intervals for push requests and meeting all together 


When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
-after we have gotten together as a group and are unable to troubleshoot our errors, after 15 minutes

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
-smaller portions work alone
-larger portions work as a pair 
-stay in the same room if applicable 

Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
-no switching partners 
-norm for everyone is the same 

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
-communicate on Slack 
-hold pull requests until everyone is aware 
-10 mins at the end of the day to discuss our status in the project 

Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
What time does this group have daily stand up?
-we will be able to work on our own after hours 
-communicate on Slack
-daily stand-ups in the beginning and end 
-shorter daily stand-up after lunch
